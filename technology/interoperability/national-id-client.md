# National ID client

Civil registration provides the source of truth for any vital event that occurs in a country.  As a result is usual that an integration with a country's National ID system is requested.  Currently OpenCRVS supports the following National ID integration functionality:



Birth events:

OpenCRVS can let a National ID system know of any birth that occurs in the country so that operations can be put in place to provide a National ID number for the child.



Death events:

OpenCRVS can let a National ID system know of any death that occurs in the country so that operations can be put in place to invalidate a National ID number for the deceased.



There are many other use cases that can be considered for future development of a more fully featured National ID integration with OpenCRVS such as:

Validation: Validating all supplied National ID numbers with a National ID system before application submission and pre-populating CR application forms with demographic data returned by the NID system for informants and parents.

Revocation: Occasionally a death may be wrongly registered either fraudulently or by mistake.&#x20;



We are continually improving our National ID integration capabilities and look forward to addressing functionality such as this in future versions of OpenCRVS&#x20;
