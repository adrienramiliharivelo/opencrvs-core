# 3.2.2.1 Prepare source files for state and district levels

{% hint style="warning" %}
As part of **OpenCRVS v1.2.0-beta (released December 2023),** you can now setup as many administrative divisions as you would like using [Humdata](https://data.humdata.org/) standards.  As a result these pages are being re-written/deprecated.  Please return in a few days for up to date content. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

Prepare your _**states**_ source file. This is a [csv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated\_values) file for every top level administrative division in your country.  You can import and create csv files in Excel or Google Drive.

| statisticalID | name     | partOf     | code             | physicalType |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| AWn3s2RqgAN   | Central  | Location/0 | ADMIN\_STRUCTURE | Jurisdiction |
| KozcEjeTyuD   | Sulaka   | Location/0 | ADMIN\_STRUCTURE | Jurisdiction |
| B1u1bVtIA92   | Pualula  | Location/0 | ADMIN\_STRUCTURE | Jurisdiction |
| dbTLdTi7s8F   | Chuminga | Location/0 | ADMIN\_STRUCTURE | Jurisdiction |

1. Using our Farajaland [states.csv](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/master/src/features/administrative/source/states.csv) file as an example, update it with the top level administrative division information for your country - do not move the file from this location.  \
   \
   Each row will represent a unique "state" in your country.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not change or re-format the header row as the code requires these names to be precise in order to parse the csv.  Do not use commas in any cell and do not have any empty rows.
{% endhint %}

\
The **statisticalID** column is a unique identifier for each state.  This could be a unique identifier you already use in your statistical analysis.  Alternatively you could create unique identifiers programatically, using Excel or using an [online UUID generator website](https://www.345tool.com/generator/random-id-generator) for which there are many free ones available.  **It is important to note that the statisticalID must contain no spaces, special characters or commas**\
****\
****The **name** column contains the human readable name for the state.  We do not currently support multilingual names for the administrative structure.  **** **It is important to note that the name must contain no commas**\
****\
****The **partOf** column shows that the state locations are part of no other higher level location. For states, this must be set to to Location/0 (zero) - You should note how this value changes for districts to show that multiple districts are part of the same state Location/\<statisticalID for parent state>: \


```
Location/0
```

\
The **code** column must be set to ADMIN\_STRUCTURE\
\
The **physicalType** column must be set to Jurisdiction\


{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** This CSV is converted into JSON during the import process.  It is very important that there are no empty extra lines in the csv document as the script will attempt to import empty states.  Any commas are treated as separators between data.  This is how a csv works.  So there must be no commas in any data field.
{% endhint %}



1.  Prepare your _**districts**_ source file. This is a [csv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated\_values) file for every second-top level administrative division in your country.  You can import and create csv files in Excel or Google Drive.\
    \
    Using our Farajaland [districts.csv](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/master/src/features/administrative/source/districts.csv) file as an example, update it with the second-top level administrative division information for your country - do not move the file from this location. \


    {% hint style="info" %}
    Note that the process to create the file is identical to that of states.csv.  The only difference is the **partOf** value.  Notice how we use the states' statisticalID to set the district as a child of a particular parent state.   For example **Ibombo** district is a child of **Central** state thanks to this partOf value. Perhaps you may also recognise that these form part of [FHIR Reference URLs](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/references-definitions.html#Reference.reference) hence the requirement for them to be absent of spaces and special characters:\
    \
    `Location/AWn3s2RqgAN`\
    ``
    {% endhint %}



    Our districts.csv file looks like this: &#x20;

| statisticalID | name     | partOf               | code             | physicalType |
