#### Clearing and restoring from a factory reset backup, all data on a server

1. SSH into your server and navigate to the following directory:

```
cd /opt/opencrvs/infrastructure/
```

2\. Ensure that your database [secrets](3.3.6-deploy-automated-and-manual.md) are available to the script as environment variables.  You can do this by running:

```
export ELASTICSEARCH_ADMIN_USER=elastic \
export ELASTICSEARCH_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<your elastic password> \
export MONGODB_ADMIN_USER=< your mongo username> \
export MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<your mongo password>
```

3\. The clear all script is run like this:

Replace and separate the \<parameters> with a space when calling the script&#x20;

```
bash ./clear-all-data.sh <REPLICAS> <ENVIRONMENT>
```

4\. Restore a factory reset like this:

Replace and separate the \<parameters> with a space when calling the script&#x20;

```
bash ./restore-metadata.sh <REPLICAS> <ENVIRONMENT>
```
