# 3.3.6 Deploy (Automated & Manual)

### Automated continuous deployment

The easiest way to deploy OpenCRVS to your servers is to use [automated continuous deployment](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/continuous-integration-vs-delivery-vs-deployment).

Refer to our supplied **"Publish image to Dockerhub"** [Github Action](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/develop/.github/workflows/publish-to-dockerhub.yml) and our supplied **"Deploy"** [Github Action](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/develop/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) in the country configuration repo to set up appropriate environments for your use case or customise your own delivery pipeline.  You could rewrite our Actions for use in [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [Travis](https://www.travis-ci.com/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) or [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/devops/pipelines/) for example.

In our example, we have 3 environments provisioned in Github. These environments allow you to provision different subdomains, secrets and optional deployment properties depending on your chosen  environment when running the action.

All of our workflows can be manually run from a shell script, so you can deploy from your local machine too if you like.  Manual steps are explained below each automated step.

To use our automated Github Action workflow, first you need to ensure that you have set up at least one, or optionally all, of the following Git [environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment):

a) **Staging** - A useful environment for testing, where the environment variable NODE\_ENV is set to **development** and you can create test user accounts with a 6 zero "000000" 2FA code during login.  This allows us to see a debug experience.

b) **QA** - A quality assurance/pseudo production environment for software testers, where the environment variable NODE\_ENV is set to **production** and a secondary exception variable QA\_ENV is set to **true.**  This allows us to see a production like experience, but with the capability of still creating test user accounts with a 6 zero "000000" 2FA code during login.

c) **Production** - A live environment, where NODE\_ENV is set to **production** & QA\_ENV is set to **false** and random 2FA is enabled so a comms Gateway must be active as in [step 3.3.3.](3.3.3-create-docker-secrets-and-provision-an-sms-gateway.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Our supplied Github Actions are examples that cannot be edited from a [fork](https://github.blog/2020-08-03-github-actions-improvements-for-fork-and-pull-request-workflows/).  You should duplicate these Github Actions files if you want to make changes for your infrastructure and update the branches that dispatch them ([here for example](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish-to-dockerhub.yml#L5)) from master, develop to master-\<your country alpha3 code>, develop-\<your country alpha3 code> as we described in the fork [section 3.2.1](../3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration/3.2.1-fork-your-own-country-configuration-repository.md).
{% endhint %}

###

### Publishing your country configuration

Before you can deploy, you need to make sure that your country configuration Docker image has compiled and has been pushed to your container registry (E.G. Dockerhub).



**Option 1: Using our automated action to publish your country configuration**

We supply an **automated action** to do this for you. Our **"Publish image to Dockerhub"** [Github Action](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/develop/.github/workflows/publish-to-dockerhub.yml) is set to **automatically run** on your country configuration repository **whenever code is pushed to a branch named master, main or develop**. This action will build and push your Docker image to Dockerhub. You must edit this action if you wish to use a different container registry.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The image will be tagged with the short Git commit hash. This hash is important to refer to and use in the deploy step.
{% endhint %}

**Global repository secrets**

These secrets below must be set as **global repository secrets** in Github as they apply to all environments and are used by the **"Publish image to Dockerhub"** [Github Action](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/develop/.github/workflows/publish-to-dockerhub.yml):thumbsup:

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DOCKER\_USERNAME   | Your [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) username to access the container registry. If you are using a different container registry, you will need to manually edit the deploy.yml appropriately. |
| DOCKER\_PASSWORD   | Your [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) password.                                                                                                                                                |
| DOCKERHUB\_ACCOUNT | The name of your Dockerhub account or organisation that forms the URL to your country config docker image on Dockerhub _**before**_ the slash. e.g: **opencrvs**                                   |
| DOCKERHUB\_REPO    | The name of your Dockerhub repository that forms the URL to your country config docker image on Dockerhub _**after**_ the slash.. e.g. **ocrvs-farajaland**                                        |

In Github, navigate to "Actions" and click "Publish image to Dockerhub" to see the output of the action that automates whenever code merges to "develop", "main", "master" branches.  Copy the git commit hash in the Action logs to see how the Docker image was tagged. You will use it in the deploy step.

**Option 2: Manually publishing your country configuration**

You can navigate to the country configuration repository to build your image from the command line if you wish:

```
cd opencrvs-farajaland
```

Export all of the required secrets as environment variables:

```
export DOCKER_PASSWORD=<your-docker-password> \
export DOCKER_USERNAME=<your-docker-username> \
export DOCKERHUB_ACCOUNT=<your-dockerhub-account> \
export DOCKERHUB_REPO=<your-dockerhub-repo>
```

Run the following script:

```
yarn compose:push:version
```

Take note of the githash at the end of the process to use in the next step ...

### Deploying

Next, you need to deploy to your server environments.



**Option 1: Using our automated action to deploy**

Create the following [Github secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-repository-and-organization-for-codespaces) for the usernames and passwords you created earlier when provisioning the servers using Ansible in [step 3.3.2](3.3.2-install-dependencies.md), along with other secrets Github will use to SSH into your servers, set the Traefik SSL hostname and connect to your container registry (E.G. Dockerhub) etc.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Using a strong password service such as [1Password](https://1password.com/) you should store the usernames and passwords you create in this section as you will need them regularly.
{% endhint %}



**Global repository secrets**

**Environment secrets**

The following secrets are likely to be unique for each environment so they should be duplicated as **environment secrets** in Github and are used by the [Github Action](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/develop/.github/workflows/deploy.yml):

The Github Action uses [this library](https://github.com/shimataro/ssh-key-action) to SSH into your environments, so needs an SSH Key id\_rsa for an SSH Key that has access.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In production, we recommend that SSH key access to servers is managed using a bastion with features for administrators that promote infrastructure security, including key management and auditing.  A good OpenSource Bastion is [Bastillion](https://www.bastillion.io/index.html).

You can deploy to your server with **the following manually triggered** action from Github named **"Deploy"**. Navigate to "Actions", and click "Deploy."

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 15.23.34.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

a) You will be required to select the environment that you wish to deploy to.&#x20;

b) You will be required to enter the OpenCRVS Core Dockerhub image tag for any tagged build on Dockerhub) to refer to the OpenCRVS Core release of choice. Usually this will be an official release if you have performed no customisations to core. E.G. **v1.2.0**

c) You will be required to enter the OpenCRVS Country Configuration version (or short Git hash tag for any tagged custom country configuration build on Dockerhub) to refer to your country configuration image and githash created by the previous "Publish image to Dockerhub" action. E.G. **4e39a2a**

d) Click Run workflow, and watch the output to make sure that the deployment was successful.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 15.31.42.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once the deployment is complete, you should be able to navigate to your OpenCRVS URLs.

To login to OpenCRVS: https://login.\<your\_domain>

To login to OpenHIM: https://openhim.\<your\_domain>

To login to Kibana: https://kibana.\<your\_domain>

To login to Minio: https://minio-console.\<your\_domain>



**Option 2: Manual deploy**

You can navigate to the Core repository to deploy from the command line if you wish:

```
cd opencrvs-core
```

Export all of the required secrets as environment variables:
