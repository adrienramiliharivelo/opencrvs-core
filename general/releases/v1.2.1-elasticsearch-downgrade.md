# v1.2.1: Release notes

**OpenCRVS v1.2.1** is a release for all implementing users who may be concerned by [Elasticsearch custom / non-OSI approved, opensource licence change](https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing).  This release shows that **for new installations only**, OpenCRVS v1.2 works with an OSI approved Apache 2.0 Elasticsearch license.

### Changes in this release:

Elasticsearch & Kibana have been downgraded from version 7.17.0 to version 7.10.2



{% hint style="warning" %}
**THIS RELEASE IS FOR NEW INSTALLATIONS ONLY!**

****

You cannot migrate production data from OpenCRVS v1.2.0 to v1.2.1.  This is because you cannot restore a snapshot of a newer version of Elasticsearch (7.17 used in OpenCRVS v1.2.0), to an older version of Elasticsearch used in this release.



In the next major release of OpenCRVS, Elasticsearch will be replaced with [Opensearch](https://opensearch.org/)
{% endhint %}



### Background:

The following explains the reason for this release as interpreted by the OpenCRVS development team. &#x20;

As far as we understand it, Elasticsearch have been in conflict with Amazon because Amazon started providing a paid for, managed cloud search "[Opensearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/)" (using a fork of Elasticsearch 7.10.2 - as was permitted by Elasticsearch's 7.10.2 Apache 2 license). Amazon renamed this fork [Opensearch](https://opensearch.org/) and released it on an OpenSource basis with a compliant Apache 2.0 license.

In response, Elasticsearch amended their OpenSource licence to stop 3rd parties from selling "managed" search services using Elasticsearch.  Our interpretation is that this seems to have been done because Elastic provide their own paid-for "managed" services.

As Elasticsearch now use a custom OpenSource license, any Elasticsearch release later than v7.10 has not been [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/).  Implementing countries of OpenCRVS will depend upon OSI approval in order to satisfy themselves that this [Digital Public Good](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) can be used without any concerns over licensing.

OpenCRVS usage of Elasticsearch does not enable the capability for anyone to provide paid-for, managed cloud search services.  We believe that the latest versions of Elasticsearch have no material effect on OpenCRVS' use of Elasticsearch.  Nevertheless, OpenCRVS remains committed to conforming with standards and we are forced to release a downgrade of Elasticsearch for immediate use on new installations.

If we have misinterpreted, and there is in fact no impact on OpenCRVS as a Digital Public Good from Elasticsearch's new custom license changes, and if representatives of Elasticsearch and Amazon AWS wish to comment, we would welcome collaboration on these release notes and will gladly amend them as appropriate.  No offence is intended to either Elasticsearch or Amazon and we may have interpreted the situation incorrectly.  We hope it is understood that we are a small team without the legal resources for a deeper investigation into all the specifics involved.

We point all users to Elasticsearch and Amazon own content that discusses this issue:
