# 11. Audit

The ability to audit actions taken in OpenCRVS increases accountability of service providers and provides the ability to identify and take action on potentially fraudulent activity. A detailed record of all actions taken on each record is captured, permanently stored, and made visible to authorised users. For a full view of actions that are audited, see the record audit table below.
