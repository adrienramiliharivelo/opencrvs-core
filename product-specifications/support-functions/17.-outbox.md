  V 1.2 Improves the existing outbox functionality to introduce it as a separate
  page  on the left navigation on the work queues

# 17. Outbox

The purpose of the Outbox page is to enable field staff working in low-resource environments to understand the send status of work they have completed, particularly in offline and low connectivity settings. &#x20;

The outbox page provides clarity of the notification to assure a user that the action performed has been submitted to the next step. It supports bulk notification submission tracking, especially when a user navigates from working offline to online.&#x20;
